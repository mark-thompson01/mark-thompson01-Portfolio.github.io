      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The CompTIA PenTest+ certification provides a comprehensive understanding of penetration testing concepts, focusing on the knowledge, methodologies, and theoretical frameworks that underpin ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment. It covers the processes, tools, and techniques necessary to identify, analyze, and document security vulnerabilities—serving as a strong foundation for anyone pursuing a role in offensive security.
      </p>
   <h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>
    About a year and a half after earning my <strong>CompTIA Security+ certification</strong>, I began considering how I would renew my existing CompTIA certifications, which were approaching their renewal period. While exploring different options to earn <strong>Continuing Education Units (CEUs)</strong>, my growing interest in <strong>penetration testing</strong> and <strong>red teaming</strong> led me to pursue the <strong>CompTIA PenTest+ certification</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    I have always believed in honing skills through <strong>hands-on practice</strong> in lab environments while maintaining a strong passion for <strong>studying and learning theory</strong>. With that in mind, I challenged myself to see how quickly I could study for and pass the PenTest+ exam while maintaining a thorough understanding of its objectives.
</p>

<p>
    To achieve this goal, I created a structured study plan, combining multiple resources to ensure a well-rounded preparation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Jason Dion's Udemy Course</strong> for foundational concepts</li>
    <li><strong>CompTIA PenTest+ Study Guide</strong> and the <strong>All-In-One Exam Guide</strong> for comprehensive knowledge</li>
    <li><strong>101Labs CompTIA PenTest+</strong> for reinforcing hands-on concepts</li>
    <li><strong>Practice Exams for PT0-002</strong> to assess and validate my readiness</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I officially began my study plan on <strong>September 17th, 2023</strong>, dedicating two full months of focused effort and commitment. On <strong>November 17th, 2023</strong>, I successfully passed the <strong>CompTIA PenTest+ PT0-002 exam</strong>—proving my ability to meet deadlines, follow structured goals, and dive deep into penetration testing fundamentals.
