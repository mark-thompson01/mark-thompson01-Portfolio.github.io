      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The CompTIA Security+ certification validates the skills required to perform core security functions and pursue a career in cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Achieving the Security+ certification allowed me to master critical security principles, including risk management, cryptography, and secure network design.
        It laid the groundwork for my transition into cybersecurity roles.
      </p>
      <p>I began preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification as I transitioned from a help desk role into my first IT Department opportunity as a Desktop Support technician. This new role gave me the perfect environment to start applying security fundamentals in a practical way.

</p>


      <p>
    Starting with the basics, I was driven to implement as much security as possible. I focused on:
    <ul>
        <li>Securing device configurations across computers and systems</li>
        <li>Changing default credentials and disabling unnecessary services</li>
        <li>Enabling encryption where applicable to protect sensitive data</li>
        <li>Setting up multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance user access security</li>
    </ul>
</p>



      
      <p>Earning the Security+ certification was a pivotal moment for me. It opened my eyes to the diversity within cybersecurity, introducing me to the wide range of roles and opportunities the industry offers. From defensive security (blue team) to offensive security (red team), I developed a strong desire to explore and master both disciplinesâ€”understanding that a well-rounded security professional must appreciate the perspectives of both offense and defense.</p>
      <p>This experience not only deepened my understanding of security best practices but also fueled my passion to continually expand my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity.
