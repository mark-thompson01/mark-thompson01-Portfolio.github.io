      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The CompTIA Network+ certification validates the technical skills needed to configure, manage, and troubleshoot wired and wireless networks.
      </p>
      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p>After achieving my CompTIA A+ certification in May of 2017, I immediately set my sights on the CompTIA Network+ certification. This was a turning point for me—where my fascination with how systems communicate and the science behind the World Wide Web truly took shape.</p>

      <p>I was captivated by understanding what happens behind the scenes when data moves—whether across local systems or global networks. Diving deep into network protocols and their integration with TCP/IP helped me grasp the core mechanics of communication between devices.

</p>

      <p>From there, I built a solid understanding of network infrastructure and key concepts like subnetting—enough to grasp how IP address schemes are organized and efficiently utilized. Exploring network security principles further deepened my awareness of the critical need to protect systems against vulnerabilities and maintain secure communication across networks.


</p>
      <p>This certification not only expanded my technical knowledge but also equipped me with the practical skills needed to understand, manage, and secure modern networks. This understanding has helped me greatly in all of the technical roles I've held.

</p>
