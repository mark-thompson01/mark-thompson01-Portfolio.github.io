      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The CompTIA A+ certification establishes foundational IT knowledge in hardware, software, and troubleshooting.
      </p>
      <h2>My Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>This is where it all begain</strong></strong>
      <p>As someone determined to break into the world of technology, the CompTIA A+ certification was my first major step toward building a solid foundation. While many may have pursued the certification as a quick milestone, I took the time to deeply immerse myself in the material, spending significantly more time than most candidates to truly understand the concepts.
      
      <p>
        Achieving the A+ certification provided me with essential knowledge in hardware and software troubleshooting, 
        preparing me to support IT systems and users.</p>

      <p>During this period, I was also working as a help desk representative, where I applied what I was learning in real timeâ€”solving issues, supporting users, and mastering the basics of IT operations. This role became more than just a job: it was an opportunity to learn everything I could about computers, technology, and troubleshooting. I approached every challenge with curiosity and treated every solved problem as a stepping stone toward expertise.
        
      </p>
      <p>I discovered my passion for building and repairing computers, gaining invaluable hands-on experience with hardware. This process ignited my interest in Linux systems, sparking my early exposure to a world that went beyond typical operating systems. My natural curiosity also led me to dive into networking fundamentals, giving me a head start on my journey toward the CompTIA Network+ certification.
